# Marvin classification
Python classification algorithm deployment using Marvin Apache.
Marvin is a ML-Ops tool created by B2W Digital to help deploying ML models.

## Installing marvin and python virtualenv
https://marvin.apache.org/marvin-platform-book/ch2_toolbox_installation/overview/
 
## Creating the engine environment
https://github.com/marvin-ai/marvin-python-toolbox

The followings steps are creating the jupyter notebook in Marvin(notebook used in this model is [here](https://github.com/letMarchezi/classificationProducts/blob/main/product.ipynb)), creating Marvin's artefacts(variables that will store important information of each step) and marking every step of the model in jupyter. Then if it is all done right you can run the model by typing in the env:
```
marvin engine-dryrun
```

If no errors appear, you can deploy the project in your localhost
```
marvin engine-httpserver
```

Type "localhost:8000/docs" in your browser to check the four API generated by Marvin.
